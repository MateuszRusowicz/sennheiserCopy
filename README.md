# sennheiserCopy
copy of Sennheiser.pl website - html and css project
view the site here:
https://sennheiser-copy.netlify.app

This project is first of my HTML and CSS projects.
It copies the layout and style of senheiser poland website. 
I did not look into inspector for exact layout copies, copied 90% of content "from sight".

Screen shots of the website attached in case it would change over time.

It's only html and css so the buttons don't work and there are no JS effects, only lauout and style.
